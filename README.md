# Path_Finding_Problem
A Python implementation of classic pathfinding algorithms (like BFS, DFS, Dijkstra, and A) to find the shortest route in a grid. The project demonstrates how different algorithms explore paths and optimize traversal.
ðŸ”¹ Features

Implementation of multiple pathfinding algorithms.

Performance comparison based on execution time and steps taken.

Visualization of the path on a grid (optional if you add GUI later).

Clean, modular code structure.

ðŸ”¹ Tech Stack

Language: C / Python / C++ (whichever youâ€™re using)

Version Control: Git + GitHub

Optional: Matplotlib / Tkinter / SDL for visualization
ðŸ”¹ Example Output

Shortest path found

Number of steps: X

Time taken: Y ms

ðŸ”¹ Future Improvements

Add visualization of pathfinding.

Optimize algorithms with heuristics.

Experiment with larger datasets.
